# Using .Net 5.0 on https://repl.it

This is a base repl to use when creating a .NET 5 project. Clicking the Run command checks if latest sdk is installed and if not then installs before attempting to run the current project. 

Alternatively you can use the dotnet command as normal to create/run projects from the command prompt.
```
$ ./dotnet -h
```
To create a sample mvc project
```
$ ./dotnet new mvc
```
To run the project click Run or at prompt
```
$ ./dotnet run
```
